# Whale Portfolio Analysis

According to _thebalancecareers.com_, a __whale__ "is a sales prospect so big that it could make a major difference to your company's business." In the context of hedge funds, a whale is a player in the financial milieu who holds an exorbitant asset portfolio enough to influence the direction of a market. Within this repository, we take a look at a selection of well-known hedge funds and analyze their risk-return profiles.

## Technologies


Before attempting to execute any _Python_ code in `risk_return_analysis.ipynb`, it is imperative that your development environment holds the following modules:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Data analysis module.

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Data visualization module.

## Installation Guide

With your _Python 3.7+_ environment, run the following commands via CLI:

```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine. 

2. Open _Jupyter Lab_ or _Jupyter Notebook_ via _Anaconda Navigator_ and navigate to the directory in which the file `risk_return_analysis.ipynb` is present. _All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line_. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and _Python_ modules are installed (see __Technologies__ and __Installation Guide__ for more details) before attempting to execute code within _Jupyter Notebook_; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors! 

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "__Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return__" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. _It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors_!.
